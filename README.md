# Google on the Terminal

## Motivation
I was going through my screen time one day and noticed how much time I was spending on Google.  Nothing wrong about Google, only that I prefer to keep an air of mystery about me rather than to let Google know at every moment every single thought I'm having.

I switched to Duck Duck Go, but their search algorithm wasn't quite as customized, naturally.  How then can one search the web effectively and privately?  Enter Google on the Terminal.
