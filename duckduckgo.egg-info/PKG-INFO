Description: # ~~Google~~ Duck Duck Go on the Terminal
        
        ## Motivation
        I was going through my screen time one day and noticed how much time I was spending on Google.  Nothing wrong about Google, only that I prefer to keep an air of mystery about me rather than to let Google know at every moment every single thought I'm having.
        
        I switched to Duck Duck Go, but their search algorithm wasn't quite as efficient (more scrolling).  How then can one search the web effectively and privately?  Enter Duck Duck Go on the Terminal.
